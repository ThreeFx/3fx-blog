## About this blog

A disclaimer in advance: I am not a frontend developer. Barring some basic HTML
I learned in school I have not written a single line of JavaScript and this blog
is my first encounter with HTML5/CSS. I have tried to make this website as
accessible as possible to screenreaders, if you have some suggestions how I can
improve on it or any other suggestions, feel free to [open an issue]() or [write
me an E-Mail]().

have written the entire styling myself in order to get more comfortable with
CSS. You can find the source of this blog hosted on
