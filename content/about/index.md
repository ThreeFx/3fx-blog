am in my first semester in the Master's curriculum. My focus is on Theoretical
Computer Science and Information Security. I also volunteer as one of the system
administrators in the [student association of computer science
students](https://vis.ethz.ch).

## About this blog

A disclaimer in advance: I am not a frontend developer. Barring some basic HTML
I learned in school I have not written a single line of JavaScript and this blog
is my first encounter with HTML5/CSS. I have tried to make this website as
accessible as possible to screenreaders, if you have any suggestions how I can
improve on it, feel free to [open an
issue](https://github.com/ThreeFx/3fx-blog/issues).

I pride myself on the fact that this blog is free of JavaScript and obnoxious
trackers. All resources, including fonts, are served directly from the same
domain from which you are visiting this site, which means that no third-party
tracking is involved in any way.

This blog is statically generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), served by
[nginx](https://nginx.com) and deployed using [Ansible](https://ansible.com). I
have written the entire styling myself in order to get more comfortable with
CSS. You can find the source of this blog hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com), as well as the
[Ansible](https://github.com/ThreeFx/ansible-hugo)
[roles](https://github.com/ThreeFx/ansible-nginx) I use for
[deploying](https://github.com/ThreeFx/ansible-acme-sh) it.
